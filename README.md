`socktile`
===
An unfinished and in-development game.

Running
---
Dev builds are avalable by going to [Github Actions](https://github.com/thisjaiden/socktile/actions) and downloading build artifcats for your platform.

Building
---
Make sure you have [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) installed.  
Clone the project, and run `cargo build --release` in the root directory. (Builds without the `--release` flag are extremely slow.)  
You can run a local gameserver by running the output executable with `server` as an argument.
